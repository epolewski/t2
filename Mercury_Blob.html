<h1>Mercury Blob</h1>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>A <em>Mercury Blob</em> is a key feature of <a href="Skynet.html">Skynet</a>'s advanced <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> models, particularly the <em><a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a></em>. This shape-shifting substance allows the <a href="Machine.html">Machine</a> to travel through <a href="Time.html">Time</a> and adapt to various environments. It has the ability to separate into smaller droplets and reintegrate with the main mass when needed.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The primary function of the Mercury Blob is to enable the <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a> to blend in with its surroundings.
