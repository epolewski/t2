<p>In the <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a></em> universe, a dinosaur version of the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>'s central processing unit (CPU) was discovered by Dr. Miles Bennet <a href="Dyson.html">Dyson</a> in his research at <a href="Cyberdyne.html">Cyberdyne</a> Systems Corporation. This artifact, which resembles a metal box assembly with small cubes, was found as part of an experiment dating back to the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="Dyson.html">Dyson</a> aimed to harness the power of this primitive artificial intelligence, intending to use it for military applications, but realized that its output rapidly degraded after just <a href="Three.html">Three</a> seconds of operation. This discovery led him to question the feasibility and morality of such advanced AI technology.</p>
