<h1>SWAT Team</h1>
<p>In <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 2: Judgement Day</em>, a SWAT team is depicted as dealing with their weapons and observing the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> emerge from the smoke. They appear tense due to seeing something they've never encountered before.</p>
<p>During the encounter, the SWAT team fires at the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>. As a result, several members get shot or injured; one member is hit in the chest, another in the back, one in the leg, and two more in their legs. The team's gas masks are removed by the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>, causing them to retreat after being affected by the tear gas.</p>
