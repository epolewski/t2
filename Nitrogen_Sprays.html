<h1>Nitrogen Sprays</h1>
<p>In <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 2: Judgment Day</em>, nitrogen sprays were created when a <a href="Tanker.html">Tanker</a> carrying <a href="Liquid_Nitrogen.html">Liquid Nitrogen</a> exploded in the <a href="Steel_Mill.html">Steel Mill</a>, causing vapor to spread throughout the facility. The freezing vapors swirled around the area, obscuring visibility and posing a danger to those present.</p>
<p>The nitrogen sprays covered the scene, creating an unusual juxtaposition of <a href="Fire.html">Fire</a> and ice as they engulfed the wreckage. The <a href="Explosion.html">Explosion</a> also left <a href="John.html">John</a> Connor with a bleeding nose due to the extreme cold, while affecting the <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a>'s movements.</p>
