<h1>Chopper</h1>
<p>The <a href="Helicopter.html">Helicopter</a>, also known as a "chopper," plays a significant role in <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 2: Judgement Day</em>. It arrives at <a href="Cyberdyne.html">Cyberdyne</a> Systems Corporation's headquarters and swings into the lot. The chopper then rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the second floor offices.</p>
<p>The <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a> (<a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>) takes control of the <a href="Helicopter.html">Helicopter</a>, forcing the pilot out of the cockpit. As it loses control due to damage, the chopper spins out of control before auto-rotating to land. Once near the ground, the <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a> regains control, hovering ten feet above the parking lot.</p>
