<h1>Children</h1>
<p>In <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 2: Judgement Day</em>, the children <a href="Danny.html">Danny</a> (6) and <a href="Blythe.html">Blythe</a> (4) are the offspring of <a href="<a href="SARAH.html">SARAH</a>.html">Sarah</a>'s foster parents, referred to as "<a href="Dad.html">Dad</a>" and "<a href="Mom.html">Mom</a>." They appear wearing rumpled PJs with hopeful expressions, standing behind Miles <a href="Dyson.html">Dyson</a> during a critical scene.</p>
<p>The children can be seen playing at a <a href="Playground.html">Playground</a>, enjoying swings, <a href="Slides.html">Slides</a>, and jungle gyms. Their innocence and youthfulness contrast starkly with the dark themes surrounding their caretakers and the film's plot.</p>
