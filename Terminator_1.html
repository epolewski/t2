<h2>The <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>'s Mission</h2>
<p>In <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 1</em>, a cyborg known as the <strong><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a></strong> was programmed with the objective of killing <a href="John.html">John</a> Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against <a href="Skynet.html">Skynet</a>. However, the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> encountered <a href="<a href="SARAH.html">SARAH</a>.html">Sarah</a> Connor instead, who was also targeted by another cyborg named the <em>T-1000</em>. As the two advanced <a href="Machines.html">Machines</a> battled for supremacy, the <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> proved to be less effective in its mission than its more adaptable counterpart.</p>

<h2>Post-Mission Impact</h2>
<p>The <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a>'s failure to successfully strike at either <a href="<a href="SARAH.html">SARAH</a>.html">Sarah</a> or <a href="John.html">John</a> Connor led to its eventual demise as it was deemed obsolete. The events of <em>Terminator 1</em> would later serve as a prelude to the subsequent sequels where new versions of <a href="Skynet.html">Skynet</a>'s weapons (including the <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a>) continued their relentless pursuit of <a href="Humanity.html">Humanity</a>'s future leaders.</p>
