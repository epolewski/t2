<h1>The Wall of Nitrogen Vapor</h1>
<p>In <em><a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> 2: Judgment Day</em>, the "Wall of Nitrogen Vapor" is an important location within the film. It showcases a unique blend of <a href="Fire.html">Fire</a> and ice, as the flames from the <a href="Steel_Mill.html">Steel Mill</a> intermingle with the nitrogen vapor.</p>
<p>This phenomenon occurs when the <a href="T_1000.html">T-1000</a> (played by Robert Patrick) encounters the wall, causing it to freeze him solid into a statue. Once the threat has been neutralized, the vapor evaporates, allowing the frozen <a href="Terminator.html">Terminator</a> to resume normal functioning.</p>
